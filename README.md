# A(nother) Portfolio Site for Katie

I originally wrote this site as a Gatsby project, but found that I wanted a couple dynamic elements, so I transferred everything into a vanilla React App. 

It's currently being hosted at master.d27k1irp0hs2t2.amplifyapp.com/; pending her approval I'll move it to a more suitable url.
